# electron-elements

electron-elements is created to hold set of custom elements to be used in
an electron app. The main benifits of custom elements inside a electron app
is that they don't need to be polyfilled. And with the great collection of 
electron-elements we hope to provide anyone creating a electron app easier way to
implement some functionality that's customizab and easy to use.
