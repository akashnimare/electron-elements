# electron-elements

electron-elements is created to have set of custom elements to be used in
an electron app. The main benifits of custom elements inside a electron app
is that they don't need to be polyfilled thus creating and maintaing them easier.
And with the great collection of electron-elements we hope to provide anyone
creating a electron app easier way to implement some functionality
that's customizab;e and easy to use.
