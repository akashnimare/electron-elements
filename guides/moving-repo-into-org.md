# Moving a repo into org

This guide is for moving a repo in to this org, if you have a electron-element
and want to move it into this org. Before we get started thanks for taking your time
and creating a electron-element we greatly appreciate it.

## Criteria before moving repo in

  - Your electron element must be working, if its work in progress and just need little bit of
  tweaks or help that we could provide from our side you can go ahead continue with process.

  - It should have valid open source license.

  - It should have docs, it you have little bit of docs and think that you can work on docs once this
  is moved into org you can go ahead and continue with the process. We will decide what do with this while
  moving this into repo

  - It should be relevant custom element that works with electron.

## Next steps

If you think you match all the criteria above great move on with this guide. If you think you don't
match the criteria but your repo is worth moving into org open up an issue and we will take it from there.

Next step is to open up a issue with following details:

  - The title of the issue should be `move in new electron-element: <name-of-your-electron-element>`
  - The body should include the link of the current repo of this element, little description about this element

And done, you done all the works, and steps needed to move this repo in to org, we will followup with other details
in the issue you opened. Feel free through read to end to get details about how published npm package into electron-elements
npm org (No yet done).

## Publishing and maintaing npm package of your element

Yet to be written, will be done once the first repo is moved in!
